# Bokeh Applications for the Groundwater Project

[The Groundwater Project's](https://gw-project.org/) mission is to make groundwater understandable by providing freely available educational materials related to the field of hydrogeology. As part of that effort, a number of educators/volunteers seek to develop interactive web applications to illustrate key concepts in hydrogeology. [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) has been identified as an ideal library for this development.

This repository aims to serve as a central location managing development of these applications.

## Getting Started

You'll need:

- Python 3.12 with bokeh >= 3.4 and all its dependencies (numpy, pandas etc.)
- An Integrated Development Environment of your choosing (recommend [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) )  
- A github account
- git installed locally

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/gmerritt123/GWProject_Bokeh`

- Ensure you can successfully run/reproduce the InfCapacityExample.py
- Identify an application/tool to develop --> See GWInux's applications for some great examples [here](https://github.com/gw-inux/Jupyter-Notebooks)
- File a [GH Issue](https://github.com/gmerritt123/GWProject_Bokeh/issues) flagging it as an application you're working on --> use the "Enhancement" label and assign yourself as the assignee
- Create a branch of your local repository:

`git branch nameOfNewApp`

- Create your app in a new folder within the repository
- Make your commits and submit a Pull Request when ready to merge
