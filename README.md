# Bokeh Applications for the Groundwater Project

[The Groundwater Project's](https://gw-project.org/) mission is to make groundwater understandable by providing freely available educational materials related to the field of hydrogeology. As part of that effort, a number of educators/volunteers seek to develop interactive web applications to illustrate key concepts in hydrogeology. [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) has been identified as an ideal library for this development.

This repository aims to serve as a central location managing development of these applications.

## Getting Started

You'll need:

- Python 3.12 with bokeh >= 3.4 and all its dependencies (numpy, pandas etc.)
- An Integrated Development Environment of your choosing (recommend [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) )  
- A github account
- git installed locally

1. Clone this repository

`git clone
